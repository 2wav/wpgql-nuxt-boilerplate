## Notes
* We've left the prettier and eslint configurations almost entirely untouched, but with some exceptions.
    * We use double quotes in house.
    * We also use semicolons.
    * We've disabled no-html because that's how we import content from Wordpress.
    * We've disabled no-console because you are going to be using it a *lot* while you're debugging server-side stuff.
* We've imported a few polyfills (fetch, object.assign, and object.entries) from [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/) that we frequently need.
* You often need to restart Nuxt after editing nuxt.config.jsâ€”do so by typing rs into the terminal session that's running the app.
* You also often need to restart Nuxt from the console if it's crashing on a GraphQL query.
* There are multiple ways to create an apollo object. We've included examples of writing as an object with properies (/pages/_.vue) and writing as a function that returns an object (SiteNav.vue).
