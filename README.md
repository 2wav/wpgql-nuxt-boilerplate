* [@nuxtjs/style-resources](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/style-resources): Share style resources across components (the `styleResources` block in `nuxt.config.js`).
* [@nuxtjs/redirect-module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/redirect-module): Easy redirects in Nuxt. Used to make `/wp-admin` link to the wordpress app (see the `@nuxtjs/redirect-module` in the `modules` section of `nuxt.config.js`).

* [jsdoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc), [jsdoc-vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc-vue), [jsdoc-export-default-interop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc-export-default-interop), [vue-template-compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-template-compiler): Generate JSDocs from comments, even in Vue templates.

## Wordpress Plugins

1. [WP Headless](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-headless/): Disable the WP frontend, to avoid confusion.

## Notes
* We've left the prettier and eslint configurations almost entirely untouched, but with some exceptions.
    * We use double quotes in house.
    * We also use semicolons.
    * We've disabled no-html because that's how we import content from Wordpress.
    * We've disabled no-console because you are going to be using it a *lot* while you're debugging server-side stuff.
* We've imported a few polyfills (fetch, object.assign, and object.entries) from [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/) that we frequently need.
* You often need to restart Nuxt after editing nuxt.config.jsâ€”do so by typing rs into the terminal session that's running the app.
* You also often need to restart Nuxt from the console if it's crashing on a GraphQL query.
* There are multiple ways to create an Apollo object. We've included examples of writing as an object with properies (/pages/_.vue) and writing as a function that returns an object (SiteNav.vue).
    * You have to use the function version if you want to use component data in the query (e.g. in the variables).
* There's currently some odd gql error spew in the console. I'm trying to track it down.
